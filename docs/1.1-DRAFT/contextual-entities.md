# Representing Contextual Entities

The _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ @graph SHOULD contain additional information about _Contextual Entities_ for the use of both humans (in `ro-crate-preview.html`) and machines (in `ro-crate-metadata.json`). This also helps to maximise the extent to which an _RO-Crate_ is self-contained and self-describing, in that it reduces the need for the consumer of an RO-Crate to refer to external information which may change or become unavailable over time.


## People

A core principle of Linked data is to use URIs to identify things such as people. The following is the minimum recommended way of representing a [author] in a RO-Crate. This property MAY be applied in the context of a directory ([Dataset]) or to a [File].

```json
{
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "@id": "./",
    "author": {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8367-6908"}
}
{
    "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8367-6908",
    "@type": "Person",
    "affiliation": "University of Technology Sydney",
    "name": "J. Xuan"
}
```

This uses an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) to unambiguously identify an author, with a _Contextual Entity_ of type [Person].

Note the string-value of the organizational affiliation. This SHOULD be improved by also providing a _Contextual Entity_ for the organization (see example below).


## Organizations as values

An [Organization] SHOULD be the value for the [publisher] property of a [Dataset] or [ScholarlyArticle] or [affiliation] property of a [Person].


```json
{
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "@id": "./",
  "publisher": {"@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041"}
}

{
  "@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "University of Technology Sydney",
  "url": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041"
}
```

An [Organization] SHOULD also be used for a [Person]'s [affiliation] property.

```json
{
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "@id": "./",
  "publisher": {"@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041"},
  "author": {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X"}
},
{
  "@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "University of Technology Sydney"
},
{
  "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X",
  "@type": "Person",
  "affiliation": {"@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041"},
  "email": "peter.sefton@uts.edu.au",
  "name": "Peter Sefton"
}
```




## More detail on ContactPoint

A RO-Crate SHOULD have contact information, using a contextual entity of type [ContactPoint]. Note that in schema.org [Dataset] does not currently have the corresponding [contactPoint] property, so the contact point would need to be given through a [Person] or [Organization] contextual entity which are related to the Dataset via a [author] or [publisher] property.


```json
{
      "@id": "./",
      "@type": "Dataset",
      "author": {"@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6121-5409"}
},
{
      "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6121-5409",
      "@type": "Person",
      "contactPoint": {
        "@id": "mailto:tim.luckett@uts.edu.au"
      },
      "familyName": "Luckett",
      "givenName": "Tim",
      "identifier": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6121-5409",
      "name": "Tim Luckett"
},
{
      "@id": "mailto:tim.luckett@uts.edu.au",
      "@type": "ContactPoint",
      "contactType": "customer service",
      "email": "tim.luckett@uts.edu.au",
      "identifier": "tim.luckett@uts.edu.au",
      "url": "https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6121-5409"
}
```



## Publications via citation property

To associate a publication with a dataset the _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ MUST include a URL (for example a DOI URL) as the `@id of a publication using the [citation] property.

For example:


```json
"citation": {"@id": "https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2386282"}
```


The publication SHOULD be described in the _RO-Crate JSON-LD_.


```json
{
  "@id": "https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2386282",
  "@type": "ScholarlyArticle",
  "author": [
    {
      "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-8367-6908"
    },
    {
      "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0690-4732"
    },
    {
      "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0003-3960-0583"
    },
    {
      "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6953-3986"
    }
  ],
  "identifier": "https://doi.org/10.1109/TCYB.2014.2386282",
  "issn": "2168-2267",
  "name": "Topic Model for Graph Mining",
  "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics",
  "datePublished": "2015"
}
```





## Publisher

The _Root Data Entity_ SHOULD have a [publisher](http://schema.org/publisher) property. This SHOULD be an [Organization](http://schema.org/Organization) though it MAY be a [Person](http://schema.org/Person).


```json
{
  "@id": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1009240",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "name": "Sample dataset for RO-Crate v0.2",
  "publisher": {
    "@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041"
  },
  "temporalCoverage": "2017"
},

{
  "@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "identifier": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041",
  "name": "University of Technology Sydney"
},
```





## Funding and grants

To associate a research project with a [Dataset], the _RO-Crate JSON-LD_ SHOULD contain an entity for the project using type [Organization], referenced by a [funder] property. The project `Organization` SHOULD in turn reference any external [funder], either by using its URL as an `@id` or via a _Contextual Entity_ describing the funder.

NOTE: To make it very clear where funding is coming from, the _Root Data Entity_ SHOULD also reference funders directly, as well as via a chain of references.


```json
{
  "@id": "https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1009240",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "funder": {
    "@id": "https://ror.org/038sjwq14"
  },
},
{
  "@id": "https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/projects/provisioner",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "description": "The University of Technology Sydney Provisioner project is ...",
  "funder": [
    {
      "@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041"
    },
    {
      "@id": "https://ands.org.au"
    }
  ],
  "identifier": "https://eresearch.uts.edu.au/projects/provisioner",
  "name": "Provisioner"
},
{
  "@id": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041",
  "@type": "Organisation",
  "identifier": "https://ror.org/03f0f6041",
  "name": "University of Technology Sydney"
},
{
  "@id": "https://ands.org.au",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "description": "The core purpose of the Australian National Data Service (ANDS) is ...",
  "identifier": "https://ands.org.au",
  "name": "Australian National Data Service"
},
```



## Licensing, Access control and copyright

If a _Data Entity_ has a [license] that is different from the license on the _Root Data Entity_, the entity SHOULD have a [license] property referencing a _Contextual Entity_ with a type [CreativeWork] to describe the license. The `@id` of the license SHOULD be its URL (e.g. a Creative Commons License URL) and, when possible, a summary of the license included using the [description] property.

The below _Data Entity_ has a [copyrightHolder] which is different from its [author]. There is a reference to an [Organization] describing the copyright holder and, to give credit, a [sameAs] relation to a web page. The [license] property here refers to <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/> which is expanded in a separate contextual entity.


```json
{
  "@id": "SciDataCon Presentations/AAA_Pilot_Project_Abstract.html",
  "@type": "File",
  "contentSize": "17085",
  "copyrightHolder": {
    "@id": "https://www.idrc.ca/"
  },
  "author": {
    "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0068-716X"
  },
  "description": "Abstract for the Pilot Project initial findings",
  "encodingFormat": "text/html",
  "license": {
    "@id": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
  },
  "sameAs": "https://www.scidatacon.org/2016/sessions/56/paper/265/"
},

{
  "@id": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "name": "CC BY 4.0",
  "description": "Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License"
},

{
  "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0068-716X",
  "@type": "Person",
  "identifier": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0068-716X",
  "name": "Cameron Neylon"
},

{
  "@id": "https://www.idrc.ca/",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "description": "Canadian Frown Corporation and funder of development research",
  "identifier": "IDRC",
  "name": "International Development Research Center"
}
```


### Metadata license

In some cases the license of the RO-Crate metadata the (JSON-LD statements in the _RO-Crate Metadata File Descriptor_) is different from the license on the _Root Date Entity_ and its content (_data entities_ indicated by [hasPart]). 

For instance, a common pattern for repositories is to license metadata as [CC0 Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), while data is licensed as [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) or similar.  This pattern allow metadata to be combined freely (e.g. the DataCite knowledge graph), while redistribution of data files would require explicit attribution and statement of their license.

To express the metadata license is different from the _Root Data Entity_, expand the _RO-Crate Metadata File Descriptor_  to include `license`:

```json
{
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "@id": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
  "identifier": "ro-crate-metadata.json",
  "about": {"@id": "./"},
  "license": {
    "@id": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"
  }
},

{
  "@id": "./",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "license": {
    "@id": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
  }
}

```

If no explicit `license` is expressed on the _RO-Crate Metadata File Descriptor_, the `license` expressed on the _Root Data Entity_ apply also on the RO-Crate metadata.

<!-- TODO: This got a bit to complicated, commented out for 1.0

## License of contextual entity metadata

In some cases, the JSON-LD metadata for some entities have been imported under a different (possibly more restrictive) license than the license of the _RO-Crate Metadata File Descriptor_ overall. For this the property [sdLicense] ("structured data license") MAY be used on the affected data entities or contextual entities. In this case it is RECOMMENDED to use [sdPublisher] ("structured data publisher") for attribution of the imported metadata:

```json
{
  "@id": "./",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "license": {
    "@id": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0"
  },
  "contentLocation": {
    "@id": "http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/"
  }  
},
{
  "@id": "http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/",
  "@type": "Place",
  "sdLicense": {
    "@id": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"
  },
  "sdPublisher": {
    "@id": "http://www.geonames.org"
  },
  "http://www.geonames.org/ontology#countryCode": "AU",
  "http://www.geonames.org/ontology#wikipediaArticle": {
    "@id": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalina_Park"
  },
  ...
}
```

In the above (abridged) example, there is no explicit license on the _RO-Crate Metadata File Description_, so the _Root Date Entity_ license [GPL 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0) would apply to RO-Crate JSON-LD statements, except for the statements on the imported <http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/>,  which metadata is re-distributed under license <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>. 

In this example the CC-BY license requires retaining "a notice that refers to this Public License" and "identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material", here respected using `sdLicense` and `sdPublisher`.  

As the RO-Crate uses _flattened_ JSON-LD, `sdLicense` should be expressed directly on each data/contextual entities where required. 

**Tip**: If metadata is imported from a source licensed as [CC0 Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/), no `sdLicense` statement is required.

## Provenance: Equipment used to create files

To specify which equipment was used to create or update a _Data Entity_, the _RO-Crate_ JSON-LD SHOULD have a _Context Entity_ for each item of equipment which SHOULD be of `@type` [IndividualProduct]. The entity SHOULD have a serial number, manufacturer that identifies it as completely as possible. In this case the equipment is a bespoke machine. The equipment SHOULD be described on a web page, and the address of the description SHOULD be used as its `@id`.


```json
{
  "@id": "https://confluence.csiro.au/display/ASL/Hovermap",
  "@type": "IndividualProduct",
  "description": "The CSIRO bentwing is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV, commonly known as a drone) with a LIDAR ... ",
  "identifier": "https://confluence.csiro.au/display/ASL/Hovermap",
  "name": "Bentwing"
}
```


Uses [CreateAction] and [UpdateAction] class to model the contributions of _Context Entities_ of type [Person] or [Organization] in the creation of files.

In this example the CreateAction has a human [agent], the object is a Place (a cave) and the Hovermap drone is the [instrument] used in the file creation event.


```json
{
      "@id": "#DataCapture_wcc02",
      "@type": "CreateAction",
      "agent": {
        "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1672-552X"
      },
      "instrument": {
        "@id": "https://confluence.csiro.au/display/ASL/Hovermap"
      },
      "object": {
        "@id": "#victoria_arch"
      },
      "result": [
        {
          "@id": "wcc02_arch.laz"
        },
        {
          "@id": "wcc02_arch_traj.txt"
        }
      ]
    },
  {
      "@id": "#victoria_arch",
      "@type": "Place",
      "address": "Wombeyan Caves, NSW 2580",
      "name": "Victoria Arch"
  }
```




## Provenance: Software used to create files

To specify which software was used to create or update a file the software application SHOULD be represented with an entity of type [SoftwareApplication], with a [version] property, e.g. from `tool --version`.

For example:

```json
{
      "@id": "https://www.imagemagick.org/",
      "@type": "SoftwareApplication",
      "url": "https://www.imagemagick.org/",
      "name": "ImageMagick",
      "version": "ImageMagick 6.9.7-4 Q16 x86_64 20170114 http://www.imagemagick.org"
}
```

The software SHOULD be associated with the [File] it created using a [CreateAction] with the [File] referenced by a [result] property. Any input files SHOULD be referenced by the [object] property.

In the below example, an image with the `@id` of `pics/2017-06-11%2012.56.14.jpg` was transformed into an new image `pics/sepia_fence.jpg` using the _ImageMagick_ software application. Actions MAY have human-readable names, which MAY be machine generated for use at scale.

```json
{
      "@id": "#Photo_Capture_1",
      "@type": "CreateAction",
      "agent": {
        "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X"
      },
      "description": "Photo snapped on a photo walk on a misty day",
      "endTime": "2017-06-11T12:56:14+10:00",
      "instrument": [
        {
          "@id": "#EPL1"
        },
        {
          "@id": "#Panny20mm"
        }
      ],
      "result": {
        "@id": "pics/2017-06-11%2012.56.14.jpg"
      }
    },
    {
      "@id": "#SepiaConversion_1",
      "@type": "CreateAction",
      "name": "Convert dog image to sepia",
      "description": "convert -sepia-tone 80% test_data/sample/pics/2017-06-11\\ 12.56.14.jpg test_data/sample/pics/sepia_fence.jpg",
      "endTime": "2018-09-19T17:01:07+10:00",
      "instrument": {
        "@id": "https://www.imagemagick.org/"
      },
      "object": {
        "@id": "pics/2017-06-11%2012.56.14.jpg"
      },
      "result": {
        "@id": "pics/sepia_fence.jpg"
      }
    },
```

Note the use of double escape `\\` so that JSON preserves the `\` character from the command line.

## Provenance: Changes to RO-Crates

To record an action which changes the DataSet's metadata, or changes its state in a publication or other workflow, a [CreateAction] or [UpdateAction] SHOULD be associated with a _Data Entity_.

A curation Action MUST have at least one [object] which associates it with either the DataSet or one of its components.

An Action which creates new _Data entities_ - for example, the creation of a new metadata file - SHOULD have these as [result]s.

An Action SHOULD have a [name] and MAY have a [description].

An Action SHOULD have an [endTime], which MUST be in ISO 8601 date format and SHOULD be specified to at least the precision of a day. An Action MAY have a [startTime] meeting the same specifications.

An Action SHOULD have a human [agent] who was responsible for authorizing the action, and MAY have an [instrument] which associates the action with a particular piece of software (for example, the content management system or data catalogue through which an update was approved) which SHOULD be of `@type` SoftwareApplication.

An Action's status MAY be recorded in an [actionStatus] property. The status must be one of the values enumerated by [ActionStatusType]: [ActiveActionStatus], [CompletedActionStatus], [FailedActionStatus] or [PotentialActionStatus].

An Action which has failed MAY record any error information in an [error](http://schema.org/error) property.

[UpdateAction] SHOULD only be used for actions which affect the DataSet as a whole, such as movement through a workflow.

To record curation actions which modify a [File] within a DataSet - for example, by correcting or enhancing metadata - the old version of the [File] SHOULD be retained, and a [CreateAction] added which has the original version as its [object] and the new version as its [result].

## Extra metadata such as Exif

Schema.org has a generic extension mechanism for encoding adding arbitrary properties and values which are not available as Schema.org properties. An example of of this is the Schema.org [recommended way (see example 2)](http://schema.org/ImageObject) of including [Exif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) technical image metadata.

To include EXIF, or other data which can be encoded as property/value pairs, add an array of references to _Anonymous Entities_ which encode each property. This example shows one property of several hundred.

```json
{
      "@id": "pics/2017-06-11%2012.56.14.jpg",
      "@type": ["File", "ImageObject"],
      "contentSize": "5114778",

      "name": "InternalSerialNumber",
      "value": "4102011002108002               "
    },
```


## Places

To associate a _Data Entity_ with a _Contextual Entity_ representing a _geographical location or region_ the entity SHOULD have a property of [contentLocation] with a value of type [Place].

This example shows how to define a place, using a [geonames](https://www.geonames.org) ID:


```json
{
  "@id": "http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/",
  "@type": "Place",
  "description": "Catalina Park is a disused motor racing venue, located at Katoomba ...",
  "geo": {
    "@id": "#b4168a98-8534-4c6d-a568-64a55157b656"
  },
  "identifier": "http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/",
  "uri": "https://www.geonames.org/8152662/catalina-park.html",
  "name": "Catalina Park"
},
```

**Tip**: To find the `@id` and `identifier` corresponding to a GeoNames HTML page like <https://www.geonames.org/8152662/catalina-park.html> click it's `.rdf` button to find the identifier <http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/> referred from <https://sws.geonames.org/8152662/about.rdf>:

```xml
<gn:Feature rdf:about="http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/">
<!--... -->
```

The place has a [geo](http://schema.org/geo) property, referencing an _Contextual Entity_ of `@type` [GeoCoordinates]:


```json
{
  "@id": "#b4168a98-8534-4c6d-a568-64a55157b656",
  "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
  "latitude": "-33.7152",
  "longitude": "150.30119",
  "name": "Latitude: -33.7152 Longitude: 150.30119"
},
```


The [GeoCoordinates] item SHOULD have a human readable [name], which is used in  generating the `ro-crate-preview.html` file.

And the place is referenced from the [contentLocation] property of the dataset.


```json
{
  "@id": "./",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "outputOf": "RO-Crate",
  "contact": {
    "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X"
  },
  "contentLocation": {
    "@id": "http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/",
  }
}
{
  "@id": "http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/",
  "name": "Catalina Park",
}
```


[Place] MAY use any of the [resources available in Schema.org](http://schema.org/geo) to describe places. Future profiles of RO-Crate may mandate the use of a subset of these. Any directory or file or _Contextual Entity_ may be geo-located. For example this file:


```json
{
  "@id": "pics/19093074_10155469333581584_5707039334816454031_o.jpg",
  "@type": "File",
  "contentLocation": {
    "@id": "http://sws.geonames.org/8152662/"
  },
  "contentSize": "132765",
  "author": {
    "@id": "https://orcid.org/0000-0002-3545-944X"
  },
```

## Subjects & keywords

Subject properties (equivalent to a Dublin Core Subject) on RO-Crate or a data entity MUST use the [about] property.

Keyword properties MUST use [keywords]. Note that by schema.org convention, keywords are given as a single JSON string, with individual keywords separated by commas.

```json
{
  "keywords": "Gibraltar, Spain, British Overseas Territory, city, map",
  "about": { "@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibraltar" },
}
```

## Time

To describe the time period which a RO-Crate Data Entity (or the RO-Crate itself) is _about_, use [temporalCoverage]:

```json
{
  "@id": "photos/",
  "@type": "Dataset",
  "name": "Photos of Gibraltar from 1950 till 1975",
  "about": {"@id": "http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gibraltar"},
  "temporalCoverage": "1950/1975"
}
```


## Digital Library and Repository content

To describe an export from a Digital Library or repository system, RO-Crate uses the _Portland Common Data Model_ ([PCDM]). A _Contextual Entity_ from a repository, representing an abstract entity such as a person, or a work, or a place SHOULD have a`@type` of [RepositoryObject](https://pcdm.org/2016/04/18/models#Object), in addition to any other types. Objects MAY be grouped together in [RepositoryCollection](https://pcdm.org/2016/04/18/models#Collection)s with [hasMember] pointing to the the [RepositoryObject](https://pcdm.org/2016/04/18/models#Object). The keys RepositoryObject and RepositoryCollection were chosen to avoid collision between the terms Collection and Object with other vocabularies.

NOTE: PCDM specifies that Files should have only technical metadata, not descriptive metadata, which is _not_ a restriction in RO-Crate. If the RO-Crate is to be imported into a strict PCDM repository, modeling of object/file relationships will be necessary.

For example, this data is exported from an [Omeka](https://omeka.org) repository:


```json
{
   "@id": "https://omeka.uws.edu.au/farmstofreeways/api/collections/6",
   "@type": "RepositoryCollection",
   "title":  "Project Materials",   
   "description": [
      "Materials associated with the project, including fliers seeking participants, lists of sources and question outline.   "
   ],
   "publisher": {"@id": "University of Western Sydney"},
   "rights": "Copyright University of Western Sydney 2015",
   "hasMember": [
      {
         "@id": "https://omeka.uws.edu.au/farmstofreeways/api/items/166"
      },
      {
         "@id": "https://omeka.uws.edu.au/farmstofreeways/api/items/167"
      },
      {
         "@id": "https://omeka.uws.edu.au/farmstofreeways/api/items/168"
      },
      {
         "@id": "https://omeka.uws.edu.au/farmstofreeways/api/items/169"
      }
   ]
},
{
   "@id": "https://omeka.uws.edu.au/farmstofreeways/api/items/166",
   "@type": "RepositoryObject",
   "title": [
      "Western Sydney Women's Oral History Project: Flier (illustrated)"
   ],
   "description": [
      "Flier (illustrated) seeking participants for the project."
   ],
   "publisher": { "@id": "https://westernsydney.edu.au"},
   "rights": "Copyright University of Western Sydney 2015",
   "originalFormat": "Paper",
   "identifier": "FTF_flier_illust"
   ],
   "rightsHolder": [
      "Western Sydney University"
   ],
   "license": { 
     "@id": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/au/"
   },
   "hasFile": [
      {
         "@id": "content/166/original_eece70f73bf8979c0bcfb97065948531.pdf"
      },
     ...
   ]
},
{
   "@type": "File",
   "@id": "content/166/original_eece70f73bf8979c0bcfb97065948531.pdf"
}
```




## Thumbnails

A [File] or any other item MAY have a [thumbnail] property which references another file.

For example, the below [RepositoryObject](https://pcdm.org/2016/04/18/models#Object) is related to four files which are all versions of the same image (via [hasFile](https://pcdm.org/2016/04/18/models#hasFile)) one of which is a thumbnail. The thumbnail MUST be included in the RO-Crate.

If [thumbnail]s are incidental to the data set, they need not be referenced by [hasPart](http://schema.org/hasPart) or [hasFile](https://pcdm.org/2016/04/18/models#hasFile) relationships. but must be in the BagIt manifest if in a _Bagged RO-Crate_.


```json
{
  "@id": "https://omeka.uws.edu.au/farmstofreeways/api/items/383",
  "@type": [
    "RepositoryObject",
    "Image"
  ],
