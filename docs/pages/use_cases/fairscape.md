# FAIRSCAPE

[FAIRSCAPE](https://fairscape.github.io/) is a framework for reusable cloud-based computations using [ARK identifiers](https://arks.org/) with rich provenance in an [evidence graph](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-80960-7_3) and the [Evidence Graph Ontology](https://w3id.org/EVI) (EVI). The command line [fairscape-cli](https://fairscape.github.io/fairscape-cli/) uses RO-Crate and BagIt for data validation and packaging in FAIRSCAPE. This approach is used for [Cell Maps for AI (CM4AI)](https://cm4ai.org/), a part of NIH's [Bridge2AI](https://commonfund.nih.gov/bridge2ai) program.
