This folder has the [MarkDown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown) content that is rendered to <https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/> by [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

A file like [background.md](background.md) appears rendered as <https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/background> - you may crosslink pages using relative links like `[background](background.md)` - the extension `.md` is replaced with `.html` in rendering.

Note that files outside `docs` are not accessible within `github.io` and must be linked to by absolute URLs, e.g. <https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md>

It is more important that pages render well at <https://researchobject.github.io/ro-crate/> than in this  preview within the GitHub repository, as some MarkDown features only apply to the GitHub Pages (e.g. the `{:toc}` macro).
