The LDaCA Program architecture consists of a set of modular services; data preservation/archiving, APIs for delivery, access control and a discovery portal for data and analysis tools as well as automated container-based notebook environments to run analytics via the Australian Text Analytics Platform (which is a component of the broader program).

## RO-Crate in the LDaCA Program

RO-Crate is the central metadata standard for all data within the LDaCA environment.

### Archiving

Provide a consitent metadata model for long term archiving and preservation. RO-Crate data is used to store archival copies of lanuage datasets using the [Oxford Common File Layout](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/standards/ocfl/). 

### API ACcess
 Provide access-controlled API access to data. Access control is important for language data as it is created by and collected from humans who have intellectual property rights over the data and some of he content may be confidential

### Discovery portals

drive discovery interfaces which index the RO-Crate metadata


### Analytical tools

standardize inputs to analytical tools, so that they do not need to be continually adapted to deal with incoming data in differing formats
