### UTS Cultural Datasets

The [UTS Cultural Datasets](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/case-studies/uts-cultural/) project is collaborating with Humanities and Social Science (HASS) researchers and is re-using existing UTS Data infrastructure to build interactive services that allow people to use the data. They make use of RO-Crate to be able to directly transfer data and mappings to the [Expert Nation database](https://expertnation.org/).
