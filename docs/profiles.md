While RO-Crates can be considered general-purpose containers of arbitrary data and open-ended metadata, in practical use within a particular domain, application or framework, it will be beneficial to further constrain RO-Crate to a specific **profile**: a set of conventions, types and properties that one minimally can require and expect to be present in that subset of RO-Crates.

Defining and conforming to such a profile enables reliable programmatic consumption of an RO-Crate's content, as well as consistent creation, e.g. a form in a user interface form firmly suggest the required types and properties, and likewise a rendering of an RO-Crate can easier make rich UI components if it can reliably assume for instance that the [`Person`](1.1/contextual-entities.html#people) always has a `affiliation` to a [`Organization`](1.1/contextual-entities.html#organizations-as-values) which has a `url` - a restriction that may not be appropriate for all types of RO-Crates.

The RO-Crate profile can also lock down serialization expectation, for instance using a particular [version of RO-Crate](specification.html), [JSON-LD context](1.1/appendix/jsonld.html?highlight=@context#ro-crate-json-ld-context) or particular [packaging](1.1/appendix/implementation-notes.html#combining-with-other-packaging-schemes) like .zip or BagIt.

## Workflow RO-Crate profile

[Workflow RO-Crate](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/) is a profile of RO-Crate 1.1, which requires at least one [data entity](1.1/data-entities.html) that is a [ComputationalWorkflow](1.1/workflows.html). This workflow must also be indicated with `mainEntity` from the [Root Data set](1.1/root-data-entity.html). The Workflow RO-Crate profile further recommends how to accompany the native workflow definition with a [abstract CWL description](https://www.commonwl.org/v1.2/Workflow.html#Operation), diagram, and meaning of named subfolders `test` and `examples`. 

Profiles can also provide recommendations, for instance Workflow RO-Crate has a list of recognized [workflow languages](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/#supported-workflow-types) and licenses. Serialization of Workflow RO-Crates are restricted to ZIP archives and with a filename ending with `.crate.zip`.

This profile of RO-Crate is used by the [WorkflowHub](https://workflowhub.eu/) both as downloadable archives of workflow entries and their metadata, but also for manual and programmatic upload of workflows, such as generated by [galaxy2cwl](https://github.com/workflowhub-eu/galaxy2cwl).  The associated service [Life Monitor](in-use/life_monitor) uses the profile as a submission format for workflow test suites, and the workflow execution service [WfExS](https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend) accesses Workflow RO-Crates through the hubs' implementation of the [Tool Registry Service API](https://about.workflowhub.eu/TRS/) to pick up the workflow to be executed.

In summary the _Workflow RO-Crate profile_ covers as of 2021-03-09:

* [`Dataset`](http://schema.org/Dataset) ([RO-Crate Root](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/root-data-entity.html#direct-properties-of-the-root-data-entity))

### Workflow Testing RO-Crate profile

[Workflow Testing RO-Crate](https://crs4.github.io/life_monitor/workflow_testing_ro_crate) is a specialization of Workflow RO-Crate used by [Life Monitor](in-use/life_monitor) to support the submission of test suites for computational workflows.

This profile is an [RO-Crate extension](1.1/appendix/jsonld.html#extending-ro-crate) that employs additional terms from the [ro-terms test namespace](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-terms/tree/master/test):

```json
[
    "https://w3id.org/ro/crate/1.1/context",
    {
        "TestSuite": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#TestSuite",
        "TestInstance": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#TestInstance",
        "TestService": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#TestService",
        "TestDefinition": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#TestDefinition",
        "PlanemoEngine": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#PlanemoEngine",
        "JenkinsService": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#JenkinsService",
        "TravisService": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#TravisService",
        "GithubService": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#GithubService",
        "instance": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#instance",
        "runsOn": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#runsOn",
        "resource": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#resource",
        "definition": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#definition",
        "engineVersion": "https://w3id.org/ro/terms/test#engineVersion"
    }
]
```

The most recent version of the context is at <https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-terms/tree/master/test>.

A Workflow Testing RO-Crate is essentially a Workflow RO-Crate with additional specification on how to structure test suites and refer to them from the root dataset:

```json
{
    "@id": "./",
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "mentions": [
        {
            "@id": "#test1"
        },
        {
            "@id": "#test2"
        }
    ],
    ...
}
```

More details are available from the [spec page](https://crs4.github.io/life_monitor/workflow_testing_ro_crate).


## Describo profiles

[Describo](tool/describo) has pre-defined _default profile_ based on the RO-Crate specifications, which informs the user interface which entity types and properties should be offered and requested when a user is editing an RO-Crate.

The [default profile](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/describo/blob/master/src/components/profiles/default/index.js) covers the recommendations in [RO-Crate 1.1 specifications](1.1/), adding UI details such as value type, labels and description for each field. 

In addition, a [Domain-specific profile](https://github.com/Arkisto-Platform/describo/wiki/dsp-index) can be created as JSON and used by Describo to customize the selection of types and properties, including adding additional [schema.org](http://schema.org/) types,  third-party vocabularies and inline ad-hoc term definitions.

In summary the _default profile_ covers as of [Describo 0.13.0](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/describo/blob/v0.13.0/src/components/profiles/default/index.js):
    
* [`Dataset`](http://schema.org/Dataset) (e.g. [RO-Crate Root](https://www.researchobject.org/ro-crate/1.1/root-data-entity.html#direct-properties-of-the-root-data-entity))

  - [`hasPart`](1.1/data-entities.html#referencing-files-and-folders-from-the-root-data-entity): `(File|Dataset|Workflow|RepositoryCollection|RepositoryObject)`
  - [`distribution`](1.1/data-entities.html#directories-on-the-web-dataset-distributions): [`DataDownload`](http://schema.org/DataDownload)

## Paradisec profile

The [PARADISEC Describo profile](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/describo/blob/master/src/components/profiles/paradisec.describo.profile.json) is built in to 
[Describo](tool/describo) and is the basis for the [PARADISEC](https://arkisto-platform.github.io/case-studies/paradisec/) RO-Crates exposed in the [Modern PARADISEC demonstrator](https://mod.paradisec.org.au/) to annotate and expose digital cultural heritage records.

In summary the _PARADISEC profile_ covers as of [Describo 0.13.0](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/describo/blob/v0.13.0/src/components/profiles/paradisec.describo.profile.json):

* [`Collection`](http://schema.org/Collection)
  - [`additionalType`](http://schema.org/additionalType): `Value`

This is a good example of how a specific profile can guide a user interface and [extend RO-Crate](1.1/appendix/jsonld.html#extending-ro-crate) with additional terms.

_Note that some RO-Crates in the [Modern PARADISEC demonstrator](https://mod.paradisec.org.au/) have evolved from this profile to conform with RO-Crate 1.1's [repository content types](1.1/provenance.html#digital-library-and-repository-content)_


## RELIANCE-RO (Earth Science Data Cubes profile)

[RELIANCE-RO](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4913285) is a profile for expressing Earth Science _Data Cubes_ in RO-Crate, being developed by the [RELIANCE project](https://www.reliance-project.eu/).

## Making an RO-Crate profile

As a starting point, an RO-Crate profile can be written down in structured human language, as exemplified by [Workflow RO-Crate](https://about.workflowhub.eu/Workflow-RO-Crate/). 

Consistent use of the key words MUST, MUST NOT, REQUIRED, SHALL, SHALL NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, RECOMMENDED, MAY, and OPTIONAL as described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) makes explicit what is a strict requirement of the profile, what are best practice recommendations, and what are open-ended extensions.

A more formal definition of the profile can take multiple forms, depending on the serialization requirements for the RO-Crate, and how open-ended or restricted the profile is intended to be:

* [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) requiring a restricted JSON form of [RO-Crate JSON-LD](1.1/appendix/jsonld.html). May include restricted JSON forms for expressing selected [data](1.1/data-entities.html) and [contextual entities](1.1/contextual-entities.html) in a certain way.
* RDF Shapes expressed in [ShEx](https://shex.io/) or [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) to check graph patterns like _`author` must be of `@type: Person` and have `affiliation` to a `@type: Organization` that has a `url` to a valid URL_
* Hard-coded validator, e.g. checking expected folders like `test/` exists or that a file really is of declared media type.

Implementors making validators may also want to first check that the [RO-Crate metadata file](1.1/structure.html#ro-crate-metadata-file-ro-crate-metadatajson) is:

* Valid [JSON](https://www.json.org/)
* Has expected/supported JSON-LD `@context`
* Valid JSON-LD Compacted form
* Valid [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/)
* Valid RDF triples
* Correct use of schema.org types/properties

Depending on requirements it may be beneficial to combine these approaches - for instance a hard-coded validator can rely on structural RO-Crate JSON checks before inspecting a particular data item in detail.
