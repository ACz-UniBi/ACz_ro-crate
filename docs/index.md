# Research Object Crate (RO-Crate)
1. Table of Contents
{:toc}

**Note**: _ROLite_ and _[DataCrate](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/datacrate)_ have been merged to **RO-Crate**. This is the new homepage [http://researchobject.org/ro-crate/](http://researchobject.org/ro-crate/)

## What is RO-Crate? 
RO-Crate is a community effort to establish a lightweight approach to packaging research data with their metadata. It is based on schema.org annotations in JSON-LD, and aims to make best-practice in formal metadata description accessible and practical for use in a wider variety of situations, from an individual researcher working with a folder of data, to large data-intensive computational research environments. 

## Where did RO-Crate come from?
RO-Crate is the marriage of [Research Objects](https://www.researchobject.org/) with [DataCrate](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/datacrate). It aims to build on their respective strengths, but also to draw on lessons learned from those projects and similar research data packaging efforts. For more details, see [background](background.md).

## Who is it for?
The RO-Crate effort brings together practitioners from very different backgrounds, and with different motivations and use-cases. Among our core target users are: a) research engaged with computation and data-intensive, wokflow-driven analysis; b) digital repository managers and infrastructure providers; c) individual researchers looking for a straight-forward tool or how-to guide to "FAIRify" their data; d) data stewards supporting research projects in creating and curating datasets.

We are  [gathering usecases](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ause-case), please help us by [adding more](https://github.com/ResearchObject/ro-crate/issues/new/choose).
  
## When can I use it?
The RO-Crate specification is currently **work in progress** :

* [RO-Crate 0.2-DRAFT](0.2-DRAFT/) (newest, in progress)
  * Annotated in [RO-Crate 0.2-DRAFTS Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sH9CscItg7PbkEOcHPX_tVXfWNP4R57ys2y3W-FfNuA/edit?usp=sharing)
* [DataCrate 1.0 review](https://docs.google.com/document/d/150SzIG8Zs3wecPTUue7wxKn6V26oi7rYucS5lxnmWZU/edit) 
  * (imported from [datacrate](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/datacrate/blob/master/spec/1.0/data_crate_specification_v1.0.md))
* [ROLite Draft 0.1.0](0.1.0) 

_Historical note_: After the initial draft, the community decided to base the specification on [DataCrate](https://github.com/UTS-eResearch/datacrate/), and changed the name from _ROLite_ to **RO-Crate**.

## How can I use it?
While we're mostly focusing on the specification, some tools already exist for working with RO-Crates:

 - [Calcyte](https://code.research.uts.edu.au/eresearch/CalcyteJS/tree/ro-crate) is a command-line tool to help create RO-Crates
 - ...
